		// 	Java uses constructors to create new objects from class blueprints.
		// 	Access modifiers include public, private, default, and protected
		// 	Everything before the body of the method is called definition of the method
		// 	Body of the method is called the implementation of the method
		// 	Inside the parenthesis, you have the arguments of the method, also called parameters
		// 	Name of the method and the arguments of the method forms the signature of the method
		// 	For the default constructor, we initialize the values to the default values
		// 	You can't call all the methods at the same time
		
		//	Default constructor provides the default values to the object like 0, null etc. 
		//	If value to the constructor is not given it will take default value.
		//	A constructor cannot have a return type.
		//	Constructor must have the same name as that of the class.
		//	Constructors cannot be marked static
		//	Constructor cannot be marked abstract
		//	Constructor cannot be overridden.
		//	Constructor cannot be Final.
